# Video-Sync-Tool
The Video Sync Tool is a web-based application that allows users to simultaneously control two videos either from YouTube or uploaded from their local machine. It provides functionality to play, pause, move forward or backward frame by frame, and sync the two videos with a single button press.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
All you need to run this application is a modern web browser that supports HTML5. This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/Hpro1/Video-Sync-Tool.git```

2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
- Each video slot can accept a YouTube link or a video file from your local machine. Enter a YouTube video link into the text box or use the file upload button to upload a video file.
- Once a video is loaded into a slot, you can control it with the corresponding control buttons. You can play, pause, move forward or backward by one frame.
- Clicking on "Sync video 2 to 1" or "Sync video 1 to 2" will sync the video in the second slot to match the current time of the video in the first slot and vice versa.
- Clicking the "Play/Pause" button in the middle of the control panel will play or pause both videos simultaneously.
